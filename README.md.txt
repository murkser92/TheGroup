Abstract. The social phenomenon “Hype” is theorized by using the concepts of Vastermann and Gartner. 
The literature on scrutinizing the Gartner Hype Cycle is reviewed. We conclude that the authors mostly rely on the analysis of web searchers or article. 
By investigating the “Bubble Tea” Hype in Germany 2011-2012 we show that sentiment analysis can add important additional insights into the course of a hype development.
